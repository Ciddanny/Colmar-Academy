Purpose of this project: Capstone project for the Build Local Website course in Code Academy

Things to work on, identified in this project: 
- Not creating so many divs;
    - There are many times I could’ve consolidated divs, for example I made each “tab” under “Start Learning” its own div which increased the amount of HTML code unnecessarily.
- Getting margins and padding just right, which I’m sure I still have room for improvement on and am aware of that, but I’m much more confident in my abilities now after completing the project than when I started.
- Familiarize myself more with align items, content and justify content as when placing elements throughout the page I found myself referencing the documentation more often than I felt was approprirate.
 

Notes:

I did not make “Our Guest Lecture” or “Fisma” gray as shown in the picture, I took the liberty of making those transitions in CSS for practice, and then applied them to all like elements around them.

I also took liberties with the Start Learnin grid, using Justify Content instead of manually updating the padding/margins. 

Natural breakpoint was observed at ~580px screen size, hence the media rule being configured to that amount.
